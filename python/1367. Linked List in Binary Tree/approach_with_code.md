[Binary Tree Path Matching Using DFS ðŸŒ³ðŸ”— - LeetCode Post](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-in-binary-tree/solutions/5750492/binary-tree-path-matching-using-dfs/)

# Intuition
My first thought was to use Depth-First Search (DFS) to explore possible paths in the binary tree and check if they match the sequence of nodes in the linked list. Each node in the binary tree can potentially be the starting point of a downward path, so the solution needs to explore the tree nodes and compare them with the linked list.

# Approach
1. I defined a helper function `dfs` that checks whether the current path in the binary tree matches the linked list. The function takes a binary tree node and a linked list node and recursively checks if their values match.
2. If a match is found, the function recursively explores both the left and right subtrees, trying to continue matching the linked list.
3. To handle cases where the linked list might start at any node in the binary tree, I used another helper function `traverse`, which explores every node in the binary tree. It checks whether the `dfs` function can find a matching path starting at the current tree node.
4. Finally, I call the `traverse` function starting from the root of the binary tree.

### How the algorithm solves examples:

1. **Example 1**: 
    - Input: `head = [4,2,8]`, `root = [1,4,4,null,2,2,null,1,null,6,8,null,null,null,null,1,3]`
    - The DFS starts from node `4` in the binary tree, where it finds a match with the head of the linked list. It continues down the left subtree, matching nodes `2` and `8`. The function returns `True` since it finds the whole linked list as a downward path.
    
2. **Example 2**: 
    - Input: `head = [1,4,2,6]`, `root = [1,4,4,null,2,2,null,1,null,6,8,null,null,null,null,1,3]`
    - The DFS finds a match starting from the root node `1`. The path continues down, matching nodes `4`, `2`, and `6`. Thus, the function returns `True`.
    
3. **Example 3**: 
    - Input: `head = [1,4,2,6,8]`, `root = [1,4,4,null,2,2,null,1,null,6,8,null,null,null,null,1,3]`
    - Although the path `1 -> 4 -> 2 -> 6` exists, the linked list has an additional node `8`. Since this node does not match any node downward in the binary tree, the function returns `False`.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: The time complexity is $$O(T \times L)$$, where $$T$$ is the number of nodes in the binary tree and $$L$$ is the length of the linked list. This is because for each node in the tree, we might need to compare the entire linked list.
  
- Space complexity: The space complexity is $$O(H)$$, where $$H$$ is the height of the binary tree due to the recursion stack used during the DFS.

I welcome any suggestions or advice on optimizing this code!
