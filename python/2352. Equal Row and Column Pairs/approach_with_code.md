# Intuition
The problem asks to find how many pairs of rows and columns in a square matrix are identical. My first thought was that I can represent both rows and columns as arrays and compare them. By using a `Counter`, we can efficiently count how many times each row appears. Then, by forming each column as a tuple and checking if it exists in the `Counter`, we can find matching pairs.

# Approach
1. Convert each row in the matrix into a tuple and store it in a `Counter`. This helps in quickly determining how many times each row appears.
2. Iterate through the columns of the matrix, which we can generate using `zip(*grid)`, and check how many times each column appears in the `Counter` of rows.
3. For every matching row-column pair, increment the result count.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n^2), where n is the size of the matrix. This is because we iterate over all rows and columns, and generating the tuples takes linear time for each row or column.
- Space complexity: O(n^2), since we store all rows and columns as tuples in the `Counter`.

# Example Walkthrough
For the first example:
```python
Input: grid = [[3,2,1],[1,7,6],[2,7,7]]
Output: 1
```
We count the rows as:
- Row 0: (3, 2, 1)
- Row 1: (1, 7, 6)
- Row 2: (2, 7, 7)

Next, we compare with the columns:
- Column 0: (3, 1, 2)
- Column 1: (2, 7, 7) → matches with Row 2
- Column 2: (1, 6, 7)

There is 1 equal row-column pair: Row 2 and Column 1.

For the second example:
```python
Input: grid = [[3,1,2,2],[1,4,4,5],[2,4,2,2],[2,4,2,2]]
Output: 3
```
The rows are:
- Row 0: (3, 1, 2, 2)
- Row 1: (1, 4, 4, 5)
- Row 2: (2, 4, 2, 2)
- Row 3: (2, 4, 2, 2)

The columns are:
- Column 0: (3, 1, 2, 2) → matches with Row 0
- Column 1: (1, 4, 4, 4)
- Column 2: (2, 4, 2, 2) → matches with Rows 2 and 3

There are 3 equal row-column pairs: Row 0 and Column 0, Row 2 and Column 2, and Row 3 and Column 2.

I welcome any suggestions or advice on how to further optimize the code!

# Code
```python3 []
class Solution:
    def equalPairs(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        # Count the occurrences of rows in the grid
        row_count = Counter(tuple(row) for row in grid)
        
        n = len(grid)
        count = 0
        
        # Check columns, form them as tuples and compare with the rows
        for col in zip(*grid):
            count += row_count[tuple(col)]
        
        return count
```
